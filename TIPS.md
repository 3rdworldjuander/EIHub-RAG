# Tips for Getting Better Results from the Documentation Search Bot

## General Query Guidelines

### 1. Location-Based Queries Work Better

- ✅ DO: "Where can I find information about user permissions?"
- ❌ AVOID: "How do I set up user permissions?"
- WHY: The bot excels at locating specific sections in documentation rather than interpreting procedural steps

### 2. Be Specific and Focused

- ✅ DO: "Where is the documentation for error code E1234?"
- ❌ AVOID: "Why am I getting errors?"
- WHY: Specific queries help the bot pinpoint relevant sections in the documentation

### 3. Use Technical Terms from the Documentation

- ✅ DO: "Where can I find details about the BatchProcessor module?"
- ❌ AVOID: "Where's the thing that processes multiple items?"
- WHY: Using exact terminology matches documentation language more accurately

### 4. Break Down Complex Questions

Instead of:
"How do I set up user permissions, configure the reporting module, and set up email notifications?"

Break it into:

- "Where is the user permissions documentation?"
- "Where can I find reporting module setup information?"
- "Where are email notification settings documented?"

### 5. Reference-Focused Queries

- ✅ DO: "Which manual covers inventory reconciliation?"
- ❌ AVOID: "What's the best way to handle inventory?"
- WHY: The bot is designed to find reference material, not make recommendations

### 6. Format-Specific Questions

- ✅ DO: "Are there any flowcharts about the approval process?"
- ✅ DO: "Which section has tables about user roles?"
- WHY: Helps the bot locate specific types of documentation elements

### 7. Version-Specific Queries

- ✅ DO: "Where can I find information about feature X in version 2.1?"
- ❌ AVOID: "What's new in the latest version?"
- WHY: Version-specific queries help locate precise documentation

## Advanced Tips

### 8. Using Document References

If you get a helpful response:

- Note the cited document and section
- Use these references in follow-up questions
- Example: "Can you find more information about X in Manual ABC, Section 3?"

### 9. Confidence Score Usage

- Pay attention to confidence scores
- For low confidence responses, try rephrasing with more specific terms
- Use document references mentioned in high-confidence responses

### 10. Iterative Questioning

Start broad, then narrow down:

1. "Which manual covers inventory management?"
2. "Where in [specific manual] is information about cycle counts?"
3. "What section of [specific chapter] discusses count frequency?"

### 11. Context-Based Queries

- ✅ DO: Include relevant system modules or components
- ✅ DO: Mention specific processes or workflows
- ✅ DO: Reference specific document types (manual, guide, FAQ)

## What to Avoid

### 12. Types of Questions That May Not Work Well

- Opinion-based questions ("What's the best way to...")
- Troubleshooting questions without specific error codes
- Questions about future features
- Complex workflow questions
- Questions requiring system analysis

### 13. Common Pitfalls

- Using ambiguous terms
- Asking multiple questions at once
- Using non-technical language
- Asking for comparisons or recommendations
- Requesting step-by-step instructions

## Tips for Interpreting Results

### 14. Understanding Responses

- Check confidence scores first
- Verify document citations
- Look for specific section references
- Note any caveats or limitations mentioned

### 15. Follow-Up Strategy

- If results aren't helpful, try:
  1. Using different technical terms
  2. Breaking down the question
  3. Asking for specific document locations
  4. Focusing on finding relevant documentation sections
