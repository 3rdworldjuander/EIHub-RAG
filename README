# AI Search Bot Disclaimer

## Purpose and Usage

This AI search bot is designed to assist in searching and retrieving information from EI-Hub and PCG documentation. It is provided as a supplementary tool to help navigate technical documentation more efficiently.

## Tips for Getting Better Results from the Documentation Search Bot

### General Query Guidelines

#### 1. Location-Based Queries Work Better

- ✅ DO: "Where can I find information about user permissions?"
- ❌ AVOID: "How do I set up user permissions?"
- WHY: The bot excels at locating specific sections in documentation rather than interpreting procedural steps

#### 2. Be Specific and Focused

- ✅ DO: "Where is the documentation for error code E1234?"
- ❌ AVOID: "Why am I getting errors?"
- WHY: Specific queries help the bot pinpoint relevant sections in the documentation

#### 3. Use Technical Terms from the Documentation

- ✅ DO: "Where can I find details about the BatchProcessor module?"
- ❌ AVOID: "Where's the thing that processes multiple items?"
- WHY: Using exact terminology matches documentation language more accurately

#### 4. Break Down Complex Questions

Instead of:
"How do I set up user permissions, configure the reporting module, and set up email notifications?"

Break it into:

- "Where is the user permissions documentation?"
- "Where can I find reporting module setup information?"
- "Where are email notification settings documented?"

### 5. Reference-Focused Queries

- ✅ DO: "Which manual covers inventory reconciliation?"
- ❌ AVOID: "What's the best way to handle inventory?"
- WHY: The bot is designed to find reference material, not make recommendations

#### 6. Format-Specific Questions

- ✅ DO: "Are there any flowcharts about the approval process?"
- ✅ DO: "Which section has tables about user roles?"
- WHY: Helps the bot locate specific types of documentation elements

#### 7. Version-Specific Queries

- ✅ DO: "Where can I find information about feature X in version 2.1?"
- ❌ AVOID: "What's new in the latest version?"
- WHY: Version-specific queries help locate precise documentation

### Advanced Tips

#### 8. Using Document References

If you get a helpful response:

- Note the cited document and section
- Use these references in follow-up questions
- Example: "Can you find more information about X in Manual ABC, Section 3?"

#### 9. Confidence Score Usage

- Pay attention to confidence scores
- For low confidence responses, try rephrasing with more specific terms
- Use document references mentioned in high-confidence responses

#### 10. Iterative Questioning

Start broad, then narrow down:

1. "Which manual covers inventory management?"
2. "Where in [specific manual] is information about cycle counts?"
3. "What section of [specific chapter] discusses count frequency?"

### 11. Context-Based Queries

- ✅ DO: Include relevant system modules or components
- ✅ DO: Mention specific processes or workflows
- ✅ DO: Reference specific document types (manual, guide, FAQ)

### What to Avoid

#### 12. Types of Questions That May Not Work Well

- Opinion-based questions ("What's the best way to...")
- Troubleshooting questions without specific error codes
- Questions about future features
- Complex workflow questions
- Questions requiring system analysis

#### 13. Common Pitfalls

- Using ambiguous terms
- Asking multiple questions at once
- Using non-technical language
- Asking for comparisons or recommendations
- Requesting step-by-step instructions

### Tips for Interpreting Results

#### 14. Understanding Responses

- Check confidence scores first
- Verify document citations
- Look for specific section references
- Note any caveats or limitations mentioned

#### 15. Follow-Up Strategy

- If results aren't helpful, try:
  1. Using different technical terms
  2. Breaking down the question
  3. Asking for specific document locations
  4. Focusing on finding relevant documentation sections

## Limitations and Accuracy

- This tool is provided "as is" without any warranties, either express or implied
- The accuracy of responses depends entirely on the source documentation provided
- The AI may occasionally:
  - Misinterpret questions or context
  - Provide incomplete or inaccurate responses
  - Generate incorrect confidence scores
- Always verify critical information against official documentation

## Source Documentation

- All responses are based on available PCG and EI-Hub documentation. All the documents referred are consolidated in the documents folder of this repository.
- The bot's knowledge is limited to the documents it has been trained on
- Citations are provided to help users locate original source material
- Source documentation may become outdated; users should verify against current official documentation

## Best Practices

1. Treat AI responses as preliminary guidance, not authoritative answers
2. Always verify critical information against official documentation
3. Use the provided confidence scores and citations to assess reliability
4. Report any inconsistencies or errors to improve the system

- The creators and contributors assume no responsibility for decisions made based on the bot's outputs
- Users are solely responsible for verifying information before implementation
- This tool is not a replacement for official support channels or documentation

## Usage Guidelines

1. Use clear, specific queries for best results
2. Check confidence scores and citations provided
3. Report errors or unexpected behavior
4. Do not rely solely on this tool for critical decisions
5. Maintain access to official documentation and support channels
